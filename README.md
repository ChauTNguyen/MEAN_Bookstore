This project is an management application designed and created for a mock bookstore. It uses MEAN, REST, and CRUD to create a simple management application. The supposed users (the staff of the bookstore) should be able to easily add, modify, and view specific data entries of the following types (books, authors, orders, customers, employees). In addition, the user should be able to view useful data such as the total amount of money a specific customer has spent at the store, but he/she should also be able to view specific entries and also lists of entries conveniently.
